**Blazing-fast Claude in your terminal. 8.8 MB binary, sub-millisecond cold start, sandboxed by default, SSH-airgap in one command.**

A drop-in alternative to `claude-code` written in C++26 — no Node, no Python, no Electron, no `npm install`. Signs in with your **Claude Pro/Max OAuth** (or `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`).

## Speed

Measured on the same Arch box, same shell, same day:

|                       | agentty (C++26)        | claude-code (Node) |
|-----------------------|------------------------|--------------------|
| Cold-start `--help`   | **< 1 ms**             | ~150 ms            |
| `--version`           | **< 1 ms**             | ~60 ms             |
| Binary on disk        | **8.8 MB**             | 222 MB (+ Node runtime) |
| Install               | `curl \| chmod +x`     | `npm i -g` + Node  |
| GC pauses mid-stream  | None                   | V8 GC              |

No JIT warmup, no `require()` graph to walk, no GC ticking while bytes stream in from the API. The TUI redraw loop is a `poll(2)` over the model stream + your input fd — every keystroke and every SSE chunk lands on the next frame.

## Why

Four things the official client doesn't try to do:

1. **Native speed.** C++26, statically linked, `posix_spawn` everywhere. Spawns in microseconds, no GC pauses mid-stream, no warmup. See the table above.
2. **One static binary.** 8.8 MB. `curl | chmod +x | run`. No Node runtime, no `npm install`, no version drift between machines.
3. **Sandbox by default.** Every shell and build call runs inside `bwrap` (Linux) / `sandbox-exec` (macOS). Workspace + system libs + network reachable; `~/.ssh`, `/etc`, other projects read-only. An approved `bash` call still can't `cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa`.
4. **One-command SSH airgap.** `agentty airgap user@host` runs the agent on a box with no direct internet — your laptop relays the bytes over SOCKS5-over-SSH. TLS pins on the real upstreams end-to-end.

Plus:

- **Workspace boundary.** Filesystem tools refuse paths outside the launch directory (`--workspace /` opts out).
- **Inline render.** Lives at the bottom of your terminal, preserves scrollback, doesn't take over the screen.
- **Reads like a single function.** The reducer is one `std::visit` over a closed event sum; the permission matrix is a `constexpr` with `static_assert`s — change a policy cell and the build breaks, not a test nobody runs.

## Install

One line. Same line to update.

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/1ay1/agentty/master/install.sh | sh
```

Detects your OS and arch, downloads the right binary from the latest release, verifies SHA256, installs to `/usr/local/bin` (if root) or `~/.local/bin`. **Re-running the same command updates** to the newest release. No `apt`, no `brew`, no version drift.

Flags: `--prefix ~/somewhere`, `--version v0.1.0`. Works on Linux + macOS, x86_64 + aarch64.

<details>
<summary><b>Distro-native packages</b> — if you'd rather your package manager track it</summary>

### Debian / Ubuntu

```bash
curl -fsSLO https://github.com/1ay1/agentty/releases/latest/download/agentty_0.1.0_amd64.deb
sudo dpkg -i agentty_0.1.0_amd64.deb       # or agentty_0.1.0_arm64.deb
```

Update: `dpkg -i` the new release's `.deb`.

### Fedora / RHEL / openSUSE

```bash
sudo rpm -Uvh https://github.com/1ay1/agentty/releases/latest/download/agentty-0.1.0-1.x86_64.rpm
```

`-U` is upgrade; works for the first install too. Same command future-proofs the update path.

### Arch Linux

```bash
yay -S agentty-bin                          # or paru, pikaur, etc.
yay -Syu agentty-bin                        # update
```

Or install the release-page `.pkg.tar.zst` with `sudo pacman -U`.

### macOS (Homebrew)

```bash
brew tap 1ay1/tap
brew install agentty
brew upgrade agentty                        # update
```

Linux Homebrew gets the prebuilt static binary; macOS builds from source (~1 min).

### Windows (Scoop)

```powershell
scoop bucket add 1ay1 https://github.com/1ay1/scoop-bucket
scoop install agentty
scoop update agentty                        # update
```

Direct `.exe`: `curl -L https://github.com/1ay1/agentty/releases/latest/download/agentty-windows-x86_64.exe -o agentty.exe`.

### Raw static binaries

Fully-static, no shared-library dependencies. Drop and run, replace on update:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://github.com/1ay1/agentty/releases/latest/download/agentty-linux-x86_64 -o agentty && chmod +x agentty
curl -fsSL https://github.com/1ay1/agentty/releases/latest/download/agentty-linux-aarch64 -o agentty && chmod +x agentty
```

Verify with [`SHA256SUMS`](https://github.com/1ay1/agentty/releases/latest) on the release page.

### From source

```bash
git clone --recursive git@github.com:1ay1/agentty.git
cd agentty && cmake -B build && cmake --build build -j
./build/agentty
```

Requires GCC 14+ / Clang 18+ / MSVC 14.40+ and CMake 3.28+.

<details>
<summary><b>Cut your own release</b> — maintainer workflow, one script</summary>

Every published artifact is built locally, no CI:

```bash
scripts/bump.sh 0.2.0        # bumps CMakeLists, builds everything, tags, uploads via gh
```

Under the hood: rewrites `project(agentty VERSION ...)`, commits the bump, builds deb/rpm/pkg.tar.zst/tarball/binaries/homebrew/scoop/AUR manifests via `scripts/release.sh`, tags `vX.Y.Z`, pushes, and `gh release create`s with every artifact attached. Single source of truth: `CMakeLists.txt`.

Or step-by-step:

```bash
scripts/release.sh                  # build every artifact into dist/, no upload
scripts/release.sh --tag v0.2.0     # build + tag + upload via gh
```

</details>

## Quick start

```bash
cd path/to/your/project   # cwd is the workspace root
agentty
```

First launch opens an auth modal:

- **OAuth (Claude Pro/Max).** Opens your browser; the callback writes the token to `~/.config/agentty/credentials.json` (`0600`). agentty picks the right header on relaunch automatically.
- **API key.** Paste an `sk-ant-…` token. Saved to the same file.

OAuth against your existing Pro/Max subscription is the main path — no extra billing, same account you already pay for.

Override order, highest priority first:

1. `-k <key>` / `--key <key>` — single-session, never written to disk.
2. `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` env var.
3. `CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN` env var.
4. The on-disk creds from the modal.

Then you're in a thread. Type, hit `Enter`. Mid-stream typing queues your next message and lands it when the current turn finishes. `Esc` cancels.

You start in the `Ask` profile — writes, shell calls, and network calls each prompt before running. `S-Tab` cycles to `Write` (autonomous) or `Minimal` (prompts for everything but pure reads). Choice persists.

Threads live at `~/.agentty/threads/<workspace-hash>/`, one JSON file each — safe to inspect, back up, delete. `^J` opens the thread list.

```bash
agentty --workspace ~/code/other-project   # run against a different workspace without cd
agentty status                              # which auth source will be used
agentty login / logout                      # non-interactive auth, useful over SSH
agentty airgap user@host                    # see below
agentty acp                                 # run as an ACP agent for Zed (see below)
```

## Keys

```
Enter      send                   ^K     command palette
Alt+Enter  newline                ^J     thread list
Ctrl+E     expand composer        ^T     todo / plan
Esc        cancel / reject        ^/     model picker
S-Tab      cycle profile          ^N     new thread
                                  ^C     quit
```

## Tools

Each tool gets a purpose-built widget: diffs render as diffs, search results group by file with line numbers, bash shows exit codes, todos become checklists.

`read`, `write`, `edit`, `bash`, `grep`, `glob`, `list_dir`, `find_definition`, `web_fetch`, `web_search`, `todo`, `diagnostics`, `git_status`, `git_diff`, `git_log`, `git_commit`, `remember`, `forget`.

## Air-gapped hosts (SSH tunnel)

Run agentty on a box that can't reach the internet directly. Your laptop relays the bytes; TLS pins on the real upstreams, so the network between laptop and remote can't MITM you.

One command, from the laptop that *does* have internet:

```bash
agentty airgap --setup user@airgapped-host    # first time: also copies your credentials
agentty airgap user@airgapped-host            # every time after
```

How: `ssh -R 1080` exposes a SOCKS5 proxy on the remote at `localhost:1080`; connections to it tunnel back over SSH and are dialed by your laptop. The remote agentty gets `AGENTTY_SOCKS_PROXY=localhost:1080` and routes every TCP destination through it — chat, OAuth refresh, `web_fetch`, `web_search`. One env var, no per-host enumeration.

> **Trust model.** Airgap doesn't trust the network between laptop and remote, but does trust the *remote* with your tokens — `--setup` copies `credentials.json` over at `chmod 600`. A compromised remote can exfiltrate your Anthropic credentials independent of the tunnel. Use it on hosts you'd already trust with the same secret.

Bare-metal version, if you'd rather not use the wrapper:

```bash
ssh -t -R 1080 user@airgapped-host \
    'AGENTTY_SOCKS_PROXY=localhost:1080 agentty'
```

Requires OpenSSH ≥ 7.6 on both ends (October 2017 — every distro has it). `AGENTTY_AIRGAP_SSH` injects extra `ssh` flags; `--remote-agentty PATH` if it isn't on the remote PATH.

### Behind a TLS-terminating corporate proxy

SOCKS keeps TLS end-to-end, so cert verification works untouched. Different story if you route through a forward proxy that re-encrypts with its own cert (Zscaler, Bluecoat, mitmproxy). Install the proxy's CA into the system trust store (`update-ca-certificates` on Debian, `update-ca-trust` on Fedora) — agentty picks up system roots at startup. As a last resort, `AGENTTY_INSECURE=1` skips peer verification entirely; don't ship that to anyone you care about.

## Use agentty inside Zed (ACP)

agentty speaks the [Agent Client Protocol](https://agentclientprotocol.com) — the
same protocol Zed uses to drive Claude Code and Gemini. Point Zed at the
`agentty acp` subcommand and your terminal agent becomes a first-class agent
panel inside the editor: streaming responses, inline diffs for every edit, and
native permission prompts before any file write or shell command.

Add this to Zed's `settings.json` (`zed: open settings`):

```json
{
  "agent_servers": {
    "agentty": {
      "command": "agentty",
      "args": ["acp"]
    }
  }
}
```

Then open the agent panel (`cmd-?` / `ctrl-?`), pick **agentty** from the agent
list, and prompt. Auth is whatever `agentty login` already set up — the ACP
process reads the same `~/.config/agentty/credentials.json`, so there's nothing
extra to configure. Set the model per-subprocess in the `args` (it does *not*
clobber your TUI's saved model):

```json
{
  "agent_servers": {
    "agentty": {
      "command": "agentty",
      "args": ["acp", "-m", "claude-haiku-4-5", "--profile", "ask"]
    }
  }
}
```

`--profile` picks how eagerly Zed prompts you before a tool runs:

- **`ask`** (default) — prompt for `write` / `edit` / `bash` / network; read-only
  inspection (`read` / `grep` / `glob` / `list_dir`) runs without a dialog so the
  loop stays fluid.
- **`minimal`** — prompt for *everything* that touches the outside world, reads
  included. Tightest leash.
- **`write`** — same write/exec/net prompts as `ask`, but never prompts for
  reads.

What works over ACP:

- **Streaming text** — the model's reply renders token-by-token in Zed's panel.
- **Tool calls** — every `read` / `edit` / `bash` / `grep` / … shows up as a
  Zed tool card with the right icon, the raw arguments, and live status
  (pending → running → done/failed).
- **Inline diffs** — `write` and `edit` emit ACP `diff` content, so Zed renders
  the file change inline and lets you review it in place.
- **Follow-along** — read/edit/write/grep tool calls carry the file path as an
  ACP `location`, so Zed can open and highlight the file the agent is touching
  in real time.
- **Permission prompts** — side-effecting tools (`bash`, `write`, `edit`,
  network) trigger Zed's native allow/reject dialog before they run; the
  `--profile` flag (above) tunes exactly which tools prompt.
- **Cancellation** — stop a turn from Zed and the in-flight stream tears down.
- **Session persistence + reload** — every session is written to agentty's
  on-disk thread store after each turn (the *same* format the TUI uses), so it
  survives a subprocess restart. Zed can call `session/load` to resume a past
  conversation: agentty replays the full transcript (user + assistant messages
  and tool cards) as `session/update` notifications, then hands back control.
  Sessions started in Zed also show up in the standalone TUI's thread picker,
  and vice versa.
- **Workspace sandbox** — file tools stay inside the session's `cwd` (the
  folder you opened in Zed); `bash` is wrapped in bwrap/sandbox-exec exactly
  like the standalone TUI.

The ACP agent is the *same* engine as the TUI — same provider, same tools, same
wire-message shaping, same permission policy — just driven over JSON-RPC on
stdio instead of a terminal. Any other ACP client (not just Zed) works the same
way.

The same `--workspace` and `--sandbox` switches the TUI accepts apply in ACP
mode (they run before the agent starts), so you can loosen or disable both from
the Zed `args`:

```json
{
  "agent_servers": {
    "agentty": {
      "command": "agentty",
      "args": ["acp", "--workspace", "/", "--sandbox", "off"]
    }
  }
}
```

- **`--workspace DIR`** — file tools refuse paths outside `DIR` (default: the
  folder you opened in Zed). Widen it to any directory, or pass `--workspace /`
  to **turn the filesystem gate off** entirely (unrestricted access).
- **`--sandbox off`** — stop wrapping `bash` / `diagnostics` in bwrap /
  sandbox-exec. Use when you already have external isolation (a container, VM,
  or you simply trust the loop). `--sandbox on` does the opposite: refuse to
  start if no OS sandbox backend is available.

With `--workspace /` the startup line honestly reports `sandbox: degraded` —
binding the whole filesystem means there's no containment left to enforce.

> Run `agentty acp` by hand and it'll sit waiting for newline-delimited
> JSON-RPC on stdin (diagnostics go to stderr, stdout is the protocol channel).
> `scripts/acp_smoke.py` is a tiny reference client that drives a full
> initialize → prompt → tool → permission round-trip.

## How it compares

|                     | agentty                               | claude-code                       | aider                               |
|---------------------|---------------------------------------|-----------------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| Language / runtime  | C++26 — single static binary          | TypeScript / Node                 | Python                              |
| Footprint           | ~9 MB                                 | npm + Node runtime                | pip + Python runtime                |
| Air-gapped mode     | Yes (`agentty airgap`, SOCKS5/SSH)    | No                                | No                                  |
| Auth                | OAuth (Pro/Max) + `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` | OAuth + `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`       | per-provider env vars               |
| Models              | Claude (Anthropic)                    | Claude (Anthropic)                | many (OpenAI / Anthropic / local …) |

Want a multi-model agent across providers? aider. Want Anthropic's first-party experience with their support behind it? claude-code. agentty is the niche pick when you specifically want a single-binary Claude client with no runtime dependency, or you need an air-gapped host through an SSH tunnel.

## How it works

Pure-functional update loop: `(Model, Msg) -> (Model, Cmd)`. Strong ID newtypes (`ToolCallId`, `ThreadId`, `OAuthCode`, `PkceVerifier`) — swapping arguments is a compile error, not a debugging session.

View is a single function `Model -> Element`. Rendering is delegated to [maya](https://github.com/1ay1/maya), a sister header-mostly TUI engine — agentty builds widget Configs from `Model` state, maya owns every chrome glyph, layout decision, and breathing animation. The host constructs no Elements.

Subprocess uses `posix_spawn` + `poll(2)` with in-process `SIGTERM → SIGKILL` deadlines on POSIX, `CreateProcessW` + a reader thread on Windows — no GNU `timeout` dependency, no `popen` quoting hazards. File writes are atomic (`write` + `fsync`/`_commit` + `rename`/`MoveFileExW`).

Deep dive: [`docs/RENDERING.md`](docs/RENDERING.md) walks the view pipeline turn-by-turn; [`docs/UI.md`](docs/UI.md) is the per-widget Config reference.

## Standalone build

```bash
cmake -B build -DAGENTTY_STANDALONE=ON
```

Statically links OpenSSL + nghttp2 + libstdc++ + libgcc when their `.a` archives are installed. libc stays dynamic on Linux/macOS (fully-static glibc breaks `getaddrinfo` and the NSS resolver). Pass `-DAGENTTY_FULLY_STATIC=ON` with a musl toolchain for a 100% static binary. Windows: implies `/MT` and pulls third-party libs from the `x64-windows-static` vcpkg triplet.

Accurate one-liner: **statically linked except libc and (usually) OpenSSL.** For a 100%-static drop-in, the [latest release](https://github.com/1ay1/agentty/releases/latest) ships pre-built `agentty-linux-x86_64` and `agentty-linux-aarch64` with zero shared-library dependencies (Alpine + musl + GCC 14.2).

## Status

Works on Linux, macOS, and Windows — all three actively tested and built daily. Prebuilt release binaries for Linux (x86_64, aarch64) and Windows (x86_64); macOS builds from source in seconds.

File bugs with `$TERM`, your terminal emulator name, and a screenshot. Code-path bugs welcome too — paste the relevant block and `git rev-parse HEAD`.
