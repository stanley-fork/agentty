**Blazing-fast Claude in your terminal. 8.8 MB binary, sub-millisecond cold start, sandboxed by default, SSH-airgap in one command.**

A drop-in alternative to `claude-code` written in C++26 — no Node, no Python, no Electron, no `npm install`. Signs in with your **Claude Pro/Max OAuth** (or `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`).

## Speed

Measured on the same Arch box, same shell, same day:

|                       | agentty (C++26)        | claude-code (Node) |
|-----------------------|------------------------|--------------------|
| Cold-start `--help`   | **< 1 ms**             | ~150 ms            |
| `--version`           | **< 1 ms**             | ~60 ms             |
| Binary on disk        | **8.8 MB**             | 222 MB (+ Node runtime) |
| Install               | `curl \| chmod +x`     | `npm i -g` + Node  |
| GC pauses mid-stream  | None                   | V8 GC              |

No JIT warmup, no `require()` graph to walk, no GC ticking while bytes stream in from the API. The TUI redraw loop is a `poll(2)` over the model stream + your input fd — every keystroke and every SSE chunk lands on the next frame.

## Why

Four things the official client doesn't try to do:

1. **Native speed.** C++26, statically linked, `posix_spawn` everywhere. Spawns in microseconds, no GC pauses mid-stream, no warmup. See the table above.
2. **One static binary.** 8.8 MB. `curl | chmod +x | run`. No Node runtime, no `npm install`, no version drift between machines.
3. **Sandbox by default.** Every shell and build call runs inside `bwrap` (Linux) / `sandbox-exec` (macOS). Workspace + system libs + network reachable; `~/.ssh`, `/etc`, other projects read-only. An approved `bash` call still can't `cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa`.
4. **One-command SSH airgap.** `agentty airgap user@host` runs the agent on a box with no direct internet — your laptop relays the bytes over SOCKS5-over-SSH. TLS pins on the real upstreams end-to-end.

Plus:

- **Workspace boundary.** Filesystem tools refuse paths outside the launch directory (`--workspace /` opts out).
- **Inline render.** Lives at the bottom of your terminal, preserves scrollback, doesn't take over the screen.
- **Reads like a single function.** The reducer is one `std::visit` over a closed event sum; the permission matrix is a `constexpr` with `static_assert`s — change a policy cell and the build breaks, not a test nobody runs.

## Install

Pick your channel — every artifact below is published from one tagged release built reproducibly by `scripts/release.sh`. SHA256s are pinned everywhere.

### One-liner (Linux + macOS, any distro)

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/1ay1/agentty/master/install.sh -o /tmp/agentty-install.sh
sh /tmp/agentty-install.sh           # installs to /usr/local/bin (root) or ~/.local/bin
```

Detects OS + arch, downloads the right binary from the latest release, verifies SHA256, drops it into your prefix. `--prefix ~/.local` and `--version v0.1.0` flags are supported.

### Debian / Ubuntu

```bash
curl -fsSLO https://github.com/1ay1/agentty/releases/latest/download/agentty_0.1.0_amd64.deb
sudo dpkg -i agentty_0.1.0_amd64.deb       # or agentty_0.1.0_arm64.deb
```

### Fedora / RHEL / openSUSE

```bash
sudo rpm -i https://github.com/1ay1/agentty/releases/latest/download/agentty-0.1.0-1.x86_64.rpm
# or aarch64
```

### Arch Linux

AUR — builds from the prebuilt static binary, no compilation:

```bash
yay -S agentty-bin                    # or paru, etc.
```

Or install the local `.pkg.tar.zst` directly from the release page with `sudo pacman -U`.

### macOS (Homebrew)

```bash
brew tap 1ay1/tap
brew install agentty
```

Linux Homebrew users get the prebuilt static binary; macOS builds from source (~1 min with the toolchain Homebrew ships).

### Windows

**Scoop** (recommended — no admin, auto-update):

```powershell
scoop bucket add 1ay1 https://github.com/1ay1/scoop-bucket
scoop install agentty
```

**Direct .exe**:

```powershell
curl -L https://github.com/1ay1/agentty/releases/latest/download/agentty-windows-x86_64.exe -o agentty.exe
.\agentty.exe
```

### Raw binaries

Fully-static, drop and run — no shared library dependencies on Linux:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://github.com/1ay1/agentty/releases/latest/download/agentty-linux-x86_64 -o agentty && chmod +x agentty && ./agentty
curl -fsSL https://github.com/1ay1/agentty/releases/latest/download/agentty-linux-aarch64 -o agentty && chmod +x agentty && ./agentty
```

Verify with [`SHA256SUMS`](https://github.com/1ay1/agentty/releases/latest) on the release page.

### From source (Linux, macOS, Windows)

```bash
git clone --recursive git@github.com:1ay1/agentty.git
cd agentty
cmake -B build && cmake --build build -j
./build/agentty
```

Requires GCC 14+ / Clang 18+ / MSVC 14.40+ and CMake 3.28+. Auth happens in-app on first launch.

### Cut your own release

Every published artifact above is built by one script, no CI:

```bash
scripts/release.sh                  # build every artifact into dist/
scripts/release.sh --tag v0.2.0     # build + tag + upload via gh
```

Produces deb, rpm, pkg.tar.zst, source tarball, raw binaries, homebrew formula, scoop manifest, AUR PKGBUILD, and `SHA256SUMS` — all derived from `CMakeLists.txt`'s `project(... VERSION X.Y.Z)` line (single source of truth).

## Quick start

```bash
cd path/to/your/project   # cwd is the workspace root
agentty
```

First launch opens an auth modal:

- **OAuth (Claude Pro/Max).** Opens your browser; the callback writes the token to `~/.config/agentty/credentials.json` (`0600`). agentty picks the right header on relaunch automatically.
- **API key.** Paste an `sk-ant-…` token. Saved to the same file.

OAuth against your existing Pro/Max subscription is the main path — no extra billing, same account you already pay for.

Override order, highest priority first:

1. `-k <key>` / `--key <key>` — single-session, never written to disk.
2. `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` env var.
3. `CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN` env var.
4. The on-disk creds from the modal.

Then you're in a thread. Type, hit `Enter`. Mid-stream typing queues your next message and lands it when the current turn finishes. `Esc` cancels.

You start in the `Ask` profile — writes, shell calls, and network calls each prompt before running. `S-Tab` cycles to `Write` (autonomous) or `Minimal` (prompts for everything but pure reads). Choice persists.

Threads live at `~/.agentty/threads/<workspace-hash>/`, one JSON file each — safe to inspect, back up, delete. `^J` opens the thread list.

```bash
agentty --workspace ~/code/other-project   # run against a different workspace without cd
agentty status                              # which auth source will be used
agentty login / logout                      # non-interactive auth, useful over SSH
agentty airgap user@host                    # see below
```

## Keys

```
Enter      send                   ^K     command palette
Alt+Enter  newline                ^J     thread list
Ctrl+E     expand composer        ^T     todo / plan
Esc        cancel / reject        ^/     model picker
S-Tab      cycle profile          ^N     new thread
                                  ^C     quit
```

## Tools

Each tool gets a purpose-built widget: diffs render as diffs, search results group by file with line numbers, bash shows exit codes, todos become checklists.

`read`, `write`, `edit`, `bash`, `grep`, `glob`, `list_dir`, `find_definition`, `web_fetch`, `web_search`, `todo`, `diagnostics`, `git_status`, `git_diff`, `git_log`, `git_commit`, `remember`, `forget`.

## Air-gapped hosts (SSH tunnel)

Run agentty on a box that can't reach the internet directly. Your laptop relays the bytes; TLS pins on the real upstreams, so the network between laptop and remote can't MITM you.

One command, from the laptop that *does* have internet:

```bash
agentty airgap --setup user@airgapped-host    # first time: also copies your credentials
agentty airgap user@airgapped-host            # every time after
```

How: `ssh -R 1080` exposes a SOCKS5 proxy on the remote at `localhost:1080`; connections to it tunnel back over SSH and are dialed by your laptop. The remote agentty gets `AGENTTY_SOCKS_PROXY=localhost:1080` and routes every TCP destination through it — chat, OAuth refresh, `web_fetch`, `web_search`. One env var, no per-host enumeration.

> **Trust model.** Airgap doesn't trust the network between laptop and remote, but does trust the *remote* with your tokens — `--setup` copies `credentials.json` over at `chmod 600`. A compromised remote can exfiltrate your Anthropic credentials independent of the tunnel. Use it on hosts you'd already trust with the same secret.

Bare-metal version, if you'd rather not use the wrapper:

```bash
ssh -t -R 1080 user@airgapped-host \
    'AGENTTY_SOCKS_PROXY=localhost:1080 agentty'
```

Requires OpenSSH ≥ 7.6 on both ends (October 2017 — every distro has it). `AGENTTY_AIRGAP_SSH` injects extra `ssh` flags; `--remote-agentty PATH` if it isn't on the remote PATH.

### Behind a TLS-terminating corporate proxy

SOCKS keeps TLS end-to-end, so cert verification works untouched. Different story if you route through a forward proxy that re-encrypts with its own cert (Zscaler, Bluecoat, mitmproxy). Install the proxy's CA into the system trust store (`update-ca-certificates` on Debian, `update-ca-trust` on Fedora) — agentty picks up system roots at startup. As a last resort, `AGENTTY_INSECURE=1` skips peer verification entirely; don't ship that to anyone you care about.

## How it compares

| Air-gapped mode     | Yes (`agentty airgap`, SOCKS5/SSH)    | No                                | No                                  |
| Auth                | OAuth (Pro/Max) + `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` | OAuth + `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`       | per-provider env vars               |
| Models              | Claude (Anthropic)                    | Claude (Anthropic)                | many (OpenAI / Anthropic / local …) |

Want a multi-model agent across providers? aider. Want Anthropic's first-party experience with their support behind it? claude-code. agentty is the niche pick when you specifically want a single-binary Claude client with no runtime dependency, or you need an air-gapped host through an SSH tunnel.

## How it works

Pure-functional update loop: `(Model, Msg) -> (Model, Cmd)`. Strong ID newtypes (`ToolCallId`, `ThreadId`, `OAuthCode`, `PkceVerifier`) — swapping arguments is a compile error, not a debugging session.

View is a single function `Model -> Element`. Rendering is delegated to [maya](https://github.com/1ay1/maya), a sister header-mostly TUI engine — agentty builds widget Configs from `Model` state, maya owns every chrome glyph, layout decision, and breathing animation. The host constructs no Elements.

Subprocess uses `posix_spawn` + `poll(2)` with in-process `SIGTERM → SIGKILL` deadlines on POSIX, `CreateProcessW` + a reader thread on Windows — no GNU `timeout` dependency, no `popen` quoting hazards. File writes are atomic (`write` + `fsync`/`_commit` + `rename`/`MoveFileExW`).

Deep dive: [`docs/RENDERING.md`](docs/RENDERING.md) walks the view pipeline turn-by-turn; [`docs/UI.md`](docs/UI.md) is the per-widget Config reference.

## Standalone build

```bash
cmake -B build -DAGENTTY_STANDALONE=ON
```

Statically links OpenSSL + nghttp2 + libstdc++ + libgcc when their `.a` archives are installed. libc stays dynamic on Linux/macOS (fully-static glibc breaks `getaddrinfo` and the NSS resolver). Pass `-DAGENTTY_FULLY_STATIC=ON` with a musl toolchain for a 100% static binary. Windows: implies `/MT` and pulls third-party libs from the `x64-windows-static` vcpkg triplet.

Accurate one-liner: **statically linked except libc and (usually) OpenSSL.** For a 100%-static drop-in, the [latest release](https://github.com/1ay1/agentty/releases/latest) ships pre-built `agentty-linux-x86_64` and `agentty-linux-aarch64` with zero shared-library dependencies (Alpine + musl + GCC 14.2).

## Status

Works on Linux, macOS, and Windows — all three actively tested and built daily. Prebuilt release binaries for Linux (x86_64, aarch64) and Windows (x86_64); macOS builds from source in seconds.

File bugs with `$TERM`, your terminal emulator name, and a screenshot. Code-path bugs welcome too — paste the relevant block and `git rev-parse HEAD`.
