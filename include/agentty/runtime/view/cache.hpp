// View-side render cache.
//
// Keeps mutable UI state out of the pure domain types (Message, ToolUse).
// The domain describes *what* a conversation is; this cache describes
// *what we've already painted for it* so we can skip rebuilding identical
// Elements every frame.
//
//   • Message markdown — finalized assistant messages whose `text` is
//     immutable. Keyed by (thread_id, msg_idx). Streaming messages carry a
//     separate `StreamingMarkdown` that caches block boundaries so each
//     delta costs O(new_chars) instead of O(total).
//
//   • Turn config + built Element — the FULL maya::Turn::Config + the
//     Element returned by Turn::build() for a settled turn (one that has
//     a successor in the message list, so by construction fully resolved).
//     Caches the agent timeline (every tool card config), permission
//     rows, markdown body. Without this, each frame walks every visible
//     message and rebuilds N tool cards × M turns from scratch; after
//     ~10 turns frame time grows enough that even direct mode feels
//     sluggish, and over an SSH-tunnelled airgap the bigger frames pay
//     per-byte transmission cost. Reusing the cached Element makes the
//     per-frame cost O(active_turn) instead of O(total_turns × tools).
//
// ── Spirit-pure reducer / self-managing cache ──
//
// History:
//   v1: process-global thread_local map keyed by (ThreadId, msg_idx),
//       with free functions like `message_md_cache(tid, idx)` and
//       `evict_thread(tid)`. The reducer called `ui::evict_thread(...)`
//       on thread switch / NewThread / compaction to invalidate stale
//       entries — type-pure (Model unchanged) but spirit-impure
//       (mutated process-global state hidden from the Model).
//
//   v2: ViewCache moved into Model::UI as a mutable member. Reducer
//       mutations were now visible in the returned Model — type-pure
//       AND surface-pure. But the reducer still had to know about a
//       render-side concern: it called `m.ui.view_cache.evict_thread()`
//       to keep stale cache entries from colliding with new ones at
//       the same (thread_id, msg_idx) key after compaction.
//
//   v3 (this file): cache keyed by (thread_id, message.id) — a stable
//       per-Message identifier generated at construction and persisted
//       to disk. Compaction creates new Messages with new IDs, so
//       old entries become orphans naturally; no explicit eviction
//       needed. The reducer never touches the cache anymore. View-side
//       memoization stays through `mutable` on Model::UI::view_cache,
//       which is the standard logical-const pattern: filling a
//       memoization slot doesn't change observable Model behavior
//       (every cache hit returns what a cache miss would have built).
//
// The runtime serializes update + view on one thread by construction,
// so no internal locking is needed.

    // To smooth this, we feed only the first `revealed_size` bytes
    // of the source each frame, and advance `revealed_size` at a
    // fixed character rate (kRevealCharsPerSec). When the model is
    // ahead of the cursor, the cursor catches up smoothly; when the
    // cursor catches up to the model, it idles waiting for more
    // bytes. On finish (settled) we snap to full size so no bytes
    // are dropped.
    //
    // `last_reveal_tick` is the wall-clock at which `revealed_size`
    // was last advanced; the next frame computes elapsed time and

// (which call evict_thread / evict_message directly) reclaims entries
// immediately rather than waiting for LRU pressure that may never come.
